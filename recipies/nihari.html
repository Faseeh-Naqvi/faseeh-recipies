    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nihari is a traditional South Asian dish, 
        renowned for its rich and flavorful characteristics. 
        Originating from the Indian subcontinent, 
        particularly popular in <strong>Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh</strong>,
         nihari is often enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or during 
         special occasions. This slow-cooked stew is primarily made 
         using tender cuts of meat, such as beef or lamb, simmered for
          <strong><em>hours</em></strong> in a blend of <em>aromatic</em> spices, including cloves, 
          cardamom, cinnamon, and coriander.</p>
          
          
          <p>The extended cooking 
          process allows the flavors to <em>meld</em> and the meat to become
           exceptionally tender, resulting in a dish with a velvety 
           texture and an enticingly complex taste. Nihari is typically
            served with naan (flatbread) or rice, and it's often 
            garnished with fresh herbs, sliced ginger, green chilies
            , and a sprinkle of lemon juice to enhance the overall 
            <em>sensory</em> experience. The dish's history and cultural 
            significance add to its allure, making nihari a cherished
             culinary delight in the region.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>For Nihari Masala(spice blend)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>5-6 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves</li>
        <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mace powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried ginger powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the beef or lamb chunks and sear them until they are lightly browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the nihari masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook for a few minutes to toast the spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough water or broth to cover the meat, and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the nihari simmer for several hours (4-6 hours) until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded. You can also use a slow cooker for this step.</li>
        <li>If using wheat flour for thickening, mix the flour with a little water to make a smooth paste and add it to the nihari. Cook for an additional 30 minutes to thicken the gravy.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and spices to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the nihari hot, garnished with chopped fresh coriander leaves, sliced green chilies, sliced ginger, and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
